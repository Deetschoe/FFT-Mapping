## Why this project?  
I have a big interest in music, but my wallet doesn’t want to drop $200+ on a DJ kit.

## How was it built?  
I used an Arduino 101 kit, added a knob, 2 touch sensors, and 2 buttons. Each has its own purpose. I programmed, designed, soldered, and assembled the entire kit into two small Amazon boxes the size of a laptop case.

## Challenges?  
I did not want to rely on a laptop, but the Raspberry Pi kits were all gone and taken. The Arduino 101 kit has Bluetooth, but it’s very low strength, so real-time audio doesn’t function properly. I wasted a lot of time trying to get around that because standalone is appealing.

## What did I learn?  
I learned a lot about soldering, Arduinos, and GPIO pins. I had never done a project solo and was worried I might not finish because of the lack of a team, but I proved myself wrong. I also miss my friends and working with other people. Never take building with friends for granted!

It was my first time doing a hardware hackathon project, and I want to do it more.
